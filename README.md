Ecdotica = The modified XITS font with addition of TironianEt (U+204A) was combinated with IFAO Grec Unicode of Jean-Luc Fournet and GNU FreeSerif (coursive); the combination, correcting the kerning, modifying part of oldstyle figures and somes philological glyphs, produce "Ecdotica", a Times-like font for textual criticism.
